# dotfiles

This houses my vimrc, and zshrc along with config files for other packages I use.

## VIMRC
For the .vimrc, you can execute `setup.vim`

## I USE ARCH BTW

My arch setup is a little wack. If I'm being completely honest, I just watched
some ordinary gamers and setup arch as fast as possible because I wanted to see
how much better Steam gaming on Linux has gotten. However after playing around more and more,
*I'm in love*. The second windows 10 goes EOL, it's wraps for my Windows install.

Currently I'm using KDE Plasma with SDDM. Time to move onto a tiling window manager.
We're gonna try awesome for a WM.
